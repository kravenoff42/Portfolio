## Overview

This will be a simple app that will let you enter the desired staring and ending coordinates for a planned tunnel in minecraft and then display instructions to you to follow to dig the tunnel successfully.

## Technologies
> **What tools will be needed?**

The Tools:
- p5.js
- minecraft (for testing)

## Core Functionality
> **What is the minimum viable product?**

The Checklist:
- Fields to enter X,Y, and Z coordinates for tunnel start
- Fields to enter X,Y, and Z coordinates for tunnel end

## Bonus Points

The Wishlist:
1. Option for excluding Y axis from calculation.
2. Visual aids for instructions
3. Options for tunnel height and width
4. Options for tunnel style (mine carts, ladders, staggering, etc)
5. Option for reverse process, if you just want to know where to start a tunnel to make it end where you want.
