## Overview
> **What's the basic idea?**

My Portfolio is a dynamically updated list of Completed and In-Progress projects that I am working on. As I add new projects to my list and enter older projects into the system the gallery will update itself to display link to everything.

## Audience
> **Who is this meant for?**

The primary audience is myself, eventually I would like to have it hosted as part of my portfolio page.

> **What do they say about the idea?**

N/A

## Platform
> **Where will this live?**

One the core aspects of the apps function is that it is entirely statically built so that I can host it in my gh-pages for convenience if access.

## Credits

- Me (obviously)

> **Who will maintain it?**

That's me as well.

> **What tools will be needed?**

The Tools:
- p5.js
- p5-manager.js

The Checklist:
- Uses only static Pages
- Taps into projectStack Sheet for project list
