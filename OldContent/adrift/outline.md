## Overview
> **What's the basic idea?**

This will be a, hopefully, simple game that follows a similar gameplay style as Raft or Minecraft: Skyblock. Where the player is given a minimal set of starting resources and then makes there world more complex from there. Possibly in space.

Mostly me, though hopefully I can find some interest from players of Minecraft nd other games like it.

> **What do they say about the idea?**
